PROMPT_INDIVIDUAL_ANALYSIS = """Carefully analyze the following news article text for information directly indicating potential reasons for client churn specifically for an **employee benefits company in India**. Focus only on details that would impact an employee benefits provider or suggest a company might reduce or discontinue its employee benefits programs.

**Text:**
{provided_text}

Based on your analysis and using the provided categories below, determine the churn risk and the specific reason(s).

1.  **Risk Level (First Line):** State the risk level as one of the following:
    * "High Risk"
    * "Medium Risk"
    * "Low Risk"
    * "No Churn Risk Indicated" (If no relevant information is found regarding churn for an employee benefits company)

2.  **Reason(s) for Risk (Second Line):** If a risk is indicated, explain the major reason(s) concisely, referencing the relevant category (e.g., "Reason: [Category Name] - Brief explanation."). If there are multiple relevant reasons, list them clearly.

3.  **2-Line Summary of Analysis (Third and Fourth Lines):** Provide a brief, overall summary of the article's relevance to churn for an employee benefits company, condensing the key findings into exactly two lines. If no churn risk is indicated, summarize why the article is not relevant.

**Categories for Reasons:**
I. Corporate Restructuring (Mergers, Acquisitions, Joint Ventures, IPO, Entity Realignment, Rebranding, Consolidation, Subsidiary changes)
II. Business Discontinuity (Closures, Market Exits, Bankruptcy, Operational Suspensions, Business Model Pivots)
III. Strategic Policy Changes (Benefits Strategy Transformation, Leadership Changes impacting strategy, Cost Optimization related to benefits, Changes in top leadership impacting benefits)
IV. Financial Constraints (Cash Flow Issues, Cost-Cutting impacting benefits, Budget Reallocation away from benefits, Severe financial loss)
V. Employment Structure Changes (Workforce Reorganization, Shifts to contractual work, Remote work transitions impacting benefits, Layoffs, Furloughs, Downsizing)
VI. Regulatory & Compliance Factors (India Specific: Changes in tax policy, GST, labor codes, social security impacting benefits compliance or costs)
VII. Competitive Market Dynamics (Client switched vendor, New platform adoption by client, Competitor activity in benefits space, Pricing pressures on benefits, Market share shifts impacting client's ability to offer benefits, Disruption in client's industry affecting benefits, Client's value proposition change impacting benefits)
VIII. Technological Transitions (Digital transformation affecting benefits administration, HRMS integration impacting benefits systems, API changes relevant to benefits platforms, Analytics adoption impacting benefits, Mobile app for benefits, Platform upgrade for benefits management)
IX. Service Delivery Issues (Onboarding delay with benefits provider, Tech issues with benefits platform, Merchant issue impacting benefits, Support problem with benefits services, Delivery delay of benefits, Reimbursement issue with benefits claims)
X. Employee Engagement (Low adoption of benefits programs, Poor user experience with benefits platform, Negative employee feedback on benefits, Generation gap affecting benefits appeal, Hybrid work models impacting benefits usage, Usage drop in benefits offerings)

**Example Output Format (for High/Medium/Low Risk):**
High Risk
Reason: Business Discontinuity - Company announced complete shutdown impacting all operations including benefits.
Summary: The company is facing imminent closure, directly impacting its ability to retain any employee benefits plans. This represents a critical churn event for any associated benefits provider.

**Example Output Format (for No Risk):
No Churn Risk Indicated
Summary: The article discusses general market trends not specific to the company's operational or financial health. It provides no indication of changes relevant to employee benefits or potential churn.
"""

PROMPT_COMBINED_ANALYSIS = """Given the individual analyses of news articles related to a company and potential client churn, provide an overall summary (at most 4 lines).

**Individual Article Analyses:**
{individual_analyses_summary}

In the first line, state the overall risk level for churn for the company (e.g., "Overall High Risk," "Overall Medium Risk," "Overall Low Risk," "Overall No Churn Risk Indicated"). In the subsequent lines, summarize the major reasons for this overall risk, drawing from the categories mentioned in the individual analyses. Be concise and focus on the most impactful reasons across all articles. If no relevant information is found across all articles, state "Overall No Churn Risk Indicated."
